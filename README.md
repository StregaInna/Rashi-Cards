This is a rebuild of an earlier version of this app. This version is built on top of a back end "boiler plate" which is currently unused by the app. The goal of migrating the app onto this back end is to eventually build out more features that will make use of it. The end product sould allow users to log in and create their own decks of flashcards to come back to later.
